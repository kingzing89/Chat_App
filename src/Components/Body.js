        <h3>Tips for People who want to Listen</h3>
        <h4>Validate their feelings</h4>
<p>We all need patient ears to listen to our woes and agonies. Venting is a cathartic release. Its a purging process where emotions are allowed to let out through: 

crying, 
yelling, 
laughing, 
shouting, 
speaking or any other means.
</p>


<h4>When someone is venting, we should let them share their stories. This gives them emotional well-being.</h4>

<p>People feel good about themselves when they vent their deepest: 

Frustrations
Anger
Sorrow
Annoyance 
The suppressed emotions get a chance to be revealed and processed for mental well-being.
</p>

<p>Venting is a process of freely expressing strong emotions, usually negative ones. The person gives voice to those emotions that are forceful. It’s a way to rationalize one’s worries and concerns, anger and frustration, doubts and fears.

Remember that when someone vents at you, it means the person is already overwhelmed and under a lot of pressure. So they need someone to express their deepest feelings.

Venting relieves stress, and the person feels lighter and relaxed after experiencing an emotional storm.

If someone is venting to you, you may feel confused about how to respond to such situations. Pouring out is healthy for the person doing it but may not be for the other person on the receiving end.

Here are a few tips that may help to respond in a healthy way to someone venting:

<h4>Never criticize their feelings as it will make them feel guilty and more upset</h4>
When someone is venting, be an active listener. When you listen to the person, it comforts them and can soothe their mental agitation.


Never criticize their feelings because it will make them feel guilty and more upset about their actions, and next time they may not come back to you for emotional support. Thus, validate their feelings as real even if you know they might be callous in certain ways.

<h4>Ask questions about their feelings</h4>
Ask questions like: 

“What is it that is upsetting?”
“Why are they looking so angry and frustrated?”
A person venting out is looking for emotional support. Thus, asking a few follow-up questions to them means that you’re concerned about them and are eager to help them resolve their issues.

<h4>Always put your patience mode “on”</h4>
Enable them to tell you their deepest secrets or emotions that are concerning without getting irritated. Always put your patience mode “on” so they feel heard and accepted.

Never be rude to them; otherwise, they feel hurt and not accepted.

Shower compassion by allowing them to pour out their heart to you
Do not give advice that may not be the need of the hour. At times, only compassionate hearing to mental agonies can actually heal deep scars and wounds. So for you, silence is the key.

Sometimes sharing grief lessens the woes, and the person may be searching for just that.

Follow a non-judgmental way of reacting 
You need to handle things calmly and let them understand the real reason for their anger or annoyance.

Avoid jump-in decisions and conclusions that can make them feel more annoyed. Help them take a pause and self-introspect about their feelings. 

You can also help them develop insight into their innermost issues and resolve them completely. In a way, you are helping them see the situation from all ends and develop a logical and rational outlook to manage their negative feelings in a better way.</p>
